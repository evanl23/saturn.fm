## Installation
To begin your journey, simply enter:
```
curl saturn.eliu.sh | bash
```

If that does not work, or if you cannot see the animations, then you can install via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh):
```bash
brew tap evanl23/homebrew-formulae
brew install saturn-fm
```

Then to listen, simply run:
```bash
saturn.fm
```

## Requirements
Terminal must support true color (24 bit), or else some colors will not render correctly. This program also relies on several external tools: 

FFplay (FFmpeg), which can be installed by: 
```
brew install ffmpeg
```

and GNU Coreutils, which can be installed by: 
```
brew install coreutils
```
