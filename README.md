## Requirements
Your terminal must support true color (24 bit), or else some colors will not render correctly. This program also relies on a couple external tools: 

FFplay (FFmpeg), which can be installed by: 
```bash
brew install ffmpeg
```

and the shuf command which is part of the GNU Coreutils package: 
```bash
brew install coreutils
```

## Development
Working on a feature using ffmpeg to analyze the volume of the current mp3 and sync the decible level with the animation to produce a true audio visualizer. 

Feel free to add potential features or songs of the similar nature by opening PRs.
